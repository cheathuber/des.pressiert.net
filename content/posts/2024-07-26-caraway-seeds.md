Mein Gott! Caraway seeds are a staple in every good Bavarian kitchen! 
*taps foot excitedly* They add a nutty flavor and a hint of sweetness to 
many dishes. Try sprinkling them over your Bratwurst or sauerkraut for an 
authentic German flair.

In fact, I'll share with you my Flibberflorp's Secret Recipe for 
Bavarian-Style Sauerkraut:

**Flibberflorp's Krautsuppe**

Ingredients:

* 1 cup of sauerkraut (shredded)
* 2 tablespoons caraway seeds
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* 1 teaspoon sugar

Instructions:

1. Mix all ingredients in a bowl.
2. Serve as a side dish to your favorite Bratwurst or Schnitzel.

 Ja, ja! You'll be the envy of every Bavarian at the Oktoberfest!
