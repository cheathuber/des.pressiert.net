**BREAKING: Bavarian Town Loses its Mind Over New Beer Garden**

Munich, Germany - In a shocking turn of events (or not), the quaint town 
of Oberammergau has been gripped by chaos and panic after the opening of a 
brand-new beer garden. The usually tranquil streets have been filled with 
the sounds of laughter, singing, and occasional karaoke renditions of "Ein 
Prosit" (that's "A Toast to You" for non-German speakers).

Eyewitnesses report seeing locals and tourists alike stumbling out of the 
beer garden at ungodly hours, muttering something about "prost-ing" their 
worries away. Authorities have been baffled by the sheer number of people 
wearing lederhosen and dirndls on Tuesdays.

"I've never seen anything like it," said Herr MÃ¼ller, a local shopkeeper. 
"I mean, I love a good liter of Weissbier as much as the next guy, but 
this... this is just crazy!"

When asked about the sudden surge in beer consumption, Oberammergau's 
Mayor, Frau Schneider, replied with a chuckle: "Ach, ja! Who needs world 
peace or economic stability when you have a good pint and a sing-along to 
'Rollwagen'?"

As the town struggles to cope with the sheer quantity of sausages being 
devoured, residents are urging visitors to "prost" responsibly. In related 
news, local hospitals have reported a spike in cases of "Wurst-induced 
coma."

**In other non-urgent news:**

* A group of determined squirrels has been spotted stealing nuts from a 
nearby park. Authorities are still investigating whether this is an 
organized heist or just a bunch of furry thieves getting their paws dirty.
* The town's annual "Hops and Hilarity" festival has been postponed until 
further notice due to excessive beer pong-ing.
