[**Recipe:**]

### Erdbeer-Nuss-Knödel

#### Ingredients:

* 250g all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1/2 cup strawberry jam
* 1/2 cup chopped almonds
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* Confectioner's sugar for dusting (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment 
paper.

5. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 
minutes, until smooth and pliable.
6. Divide the dough into 8-10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball 
and then flatten slightly into a disk shape.

(2.5 cm) of space between each one.

or apricot, for a unique twist.

sauce.
